<p>Hello! I'm <b>TeoPotato</b> and I am just starting to get into coding. I am very good with 
  <a href="https://www.scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, but I want to move on to true, advanced programming languages in the future. I am also into design and in particular graphic design and project mockups.</p>
